Hello! 

This is a basic single page web application based on the popular game "Connect Four". 

The initial intro form allows you to engage in two different game modes 
1) Versus another human opponent.
2) Versus an "AI" opponent. 

To play: 
Simply hover your mouse cursor over the column you would like to drop your gamepiece and click. 



Known bugs: 
Piece highlighter function may at times highlight multiple cells at once. Working on a fix for this
Computer is on a 10000 setInterval timer so if it takes a while for the computer to make a move - it's not frozen!
